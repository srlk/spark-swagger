# spark-swagger

# Refactored the application as follows:
1. Moved api calls to their own class and user swagger annotations and spark style lambdas to define the api
1. Included some dummy data to demonstrate the api
1. Included swagger-ui
1. To use: 
* Run App.main()
* Navigate to: http://localhost:4567

This example was heavily inspired by the below linked post and it's code repository [https://github.com/srlk/spark-swagger].

# Original README.md is below
Example application for Java Spark microframework and Swagger integration.
